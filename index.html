                    With so many types of salons to choose from, it can be overwhelming when selecting the right one to work for. There are several factors that come into play – such as training, salary, benefits, job security, the commute, your commitment and much more.

                    There are so many salons out there that it can be hard to know where to start and what one would be a good fit. A good trait to find in a salon is whether or not they have experienced stylists who will guide, teach and mentor you to give you the proper leadership  one needs to be successful and happy. A successful future deserves the best team of hair stylists to learn from and a salon owner to support and guide you in the right directions at a pivotal time and stage in your development as a professional hair stylist.

                    Salons also offer much more than just the standard services today that require much more education and experience in order to excel and build a sustainable clientele. When choosing the right place to work, one that fits all of your needs, consider all of the possibilities and opportunities that are presented before making any decisions based on opinion.

                            “As a veteran stylist at much different type of salon, I decided I needed a change in order to advance my career and I went all in without a clientele,  but I was willing to learn from the best of hair stylists and to be coached the Fringe way by such a legend. I put my ego aside and went in blind trusting the programs Ashley has had such success with in the past. I knew I wanted to make more money meaning I had to learn new techniques. Ashley being the patient person that she is, taught me in a way I could best learn.”
